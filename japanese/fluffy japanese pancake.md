Ingredients for 3 pancakes ( 1 to 2 servings )

## Ingredients
### Cake batter base
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 teaspoon (5g) granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoon(20g) whole milk
* 1 tablespoon(10g)flavorless vegetable oil
* 3 tablespoons(30g) all-purpose flour
* 1/3 teaspoon of baking powder
* A pinch of salt
* A dash of vanilla paste

### Meringue
* 2 egg whites
* 1 heaping tablespoon(20g) sugar

## Instructions
1. First, whisk together the egg yolk and sugar until pale. Add oil and milk in 3 times and whisk well each time. Use a whisk with thin wires, as thick wires will make a less airy batter.
2. Shift together the flour and baking powder directly into a bowl and whisk well. You want to make sure the batter is sticky. We have to develop the gluten at this point and to hold lots of meringue adding later.
3. Add a pinch of salt and a dash of vanilla paste and give it a good whisk. Set aside while we make meringue.
4. Start whisking by using a hand mixer on low. When all the egg white becomes a form, add a half of granulated sugar. Keep whisking until the sugar dissolve and shiny, add the rest of the sugar. When all the sugar dissolves and meringue looks shiny, turn the speed to high and whisk until stiff peak forms. It’s going to take about 3 minutes.
5. Let’s combine the cake batter base and meringue. Add 1/3 of meringue, use your whisk like this tapping motion. As a professional pastry chef, I insist on the productivity. Using a whisk to combine is much more effective than a spatula. Each wire of the whisk mix the meringue and batter quickly without deflating the meringue. When 80% of meringue is mixed, making a circular motion to combine. Do not mix completely at this point otherwise you will over-do the batter.
6. Add the next 1/3 of meringue, and do the same as before. Add the rest of the meringue, mix to 80 to 90 %. Switch to a spatula, mix using folding motion to make sure every part is mixed. Look at the fluffy cake batter! It holds it’s shaping when we drop if you properly mixed.
7. Preheat the electric griddle, which is called “Hot plate” in Japanese on very low heat. Of course you can use stove and pan. I strongly recommend to use a non-stick pan. Keep it mind that using the very low heat.
8. Grease the surface slightly with vegetable oil. Do not use butter to bake the pancake. As you know, butter is not pure fat. It contains proteins and another agent which easy to burn.
Ladle the batter onto the griddle. Put the rest of the batter evenly as much as you can. Put the lid on and cook for 3 minutes or until smells good. Pay close attention to cook nicely.
9. Carefully flip it over. If it’s not easy to peel off from the pan, cook a minute more. Put the lid on and cook 3 minutes more.
10. Transfer to a serving dish. Put whipped honey butter and dust with powdered sugar. Drizzle warm maple syrup and serve immediately.
