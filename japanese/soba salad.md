# Soba salad
[from justonecookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/soba-salad/)
## Ingredients
* 7 oz soba (buckwheat) noodles (7 oz = 200 g = 2-3 bundles)
* 2 green onions/scallions
* 1 bunch cilantro (.7 oz = 20 g)
* 1 Tbsp white sesame seeds (roasted/toasted)
* For Dressing
* 1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
* 3 Tbsp sesame oil
* 1/2 tsp crushed red peppers (red pepper flakes)
* 3 Tbsp honey
* 3 Tbsp soy sauce
## Instructions
1. To make the dressing, combine 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil, 3 Tbsp. sesame oil, and Â½ tsp. crushed red peppers in a small saucepan.
2.  Whisk all together and infuse the oil over medium heat for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can put these ingredients in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 3 minutes. Set aside to let it cool a bit; be careful while handling as it'll get very hot.
3. Add 3 Tbsp. honey and 3 Tbsp. soy sauce to the oil mixture.
4. Whisk all together until honey is completely dissolved.
5. Bring water to a boil (You do not need to salt the water for cooking soba.). Cook the soba noodles according to the package instructions, but make sure they are al dente. Drain into a colander and rinse the soba noodles under cold running water. This step is important to remove the starch from the soba noodles. Drain well and transfer to a large bowl.
6. Thinly slice the green onions and chop cilantro into small pieces.
7. Combine the soba noodles, dressing, green onion, cilantro, and sesame seeds in the bowl.
8. Toss everything together. Transfer to a serving bowl or plate. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
